### Neovim config

Removed the tab ui, did not like it. Just use buffer search only


TODO:
- Disable mouse
-  Set conceallevel to 0 (this removes that thing where string "" are hidden in json) https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/config/options.lua
`SPACE uc`
- get git blame plugin (like in vscode) for neovim
